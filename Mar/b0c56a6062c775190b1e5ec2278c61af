The presenter line-up changes continue to be wrung at SABC radio stations, with the public broadcaster revealing these for another three stations – SAfm, Lesedi FM and Motsweding FM. SAfm has several new presenters joining the family, including Ayanda Allie Paine, Songezo Mabece, Chris Vick, and Mathumo Manaka. The weekday programming schedule between 06:00 and 13:00 remains unchanged. Ayanda Allie Paine will host the weekday 13:00-15:00 slot, followed by Masechaba Mtolo on the coveted afternoon drive show (weekdays, 15:00-18:00). Market Update (18:00–19:00) and Sport On (19:00–20:00) remain unchanged. Later in the evening on Monday and Tuesday (20:00-22:00) Songezo Mabece unpacks the key socio, economic and political matters of the day, with Chris Vick taking over Wednesday and Thursday at the same time, bringing his in-depth knowledge of political and social issues. Mathumo Manaka ushers in the weekend (Fridays, 21:00-00:00) with an all music show and again on Saturday and Sunday (13:00–16:00) with the best music selection. The rest of the weekend schedule will remain the same. In a statement SAfm said, “In order to retain relevance in the broadcasting space, it is imperative to continuously refresh, strengthen and rotate talent to ensure that we lead the conversation, as we have for the last 82 years. The station believes its existing talent and with the introduction of new personalities, will ensure it remains relevant in the industry.” Acting station manager Peter Mashamba adds, “It is vital to keep abreast with developments in the industry and adapt to the ever changing media landscape and serve the audiences holistically. The SAfm offering aims to ensure we remain relevant and ultimately deliver more on our mandate.” African Language Station Lesedi FM has also seen some presenter line-up shifts, with the objective of the moves being the defence and increasing of the station’s audience. The Monate Breakfast’ show will be served by Seipati ‘Twasa’ Seoke and Nkunyana ‘Skuzabell’ Nkunyana from Monday to Friday (06:30-09:00). Tholoana ‘ThuliBaby’ Moletsane will present ‘Mathemalodi’ from 09:00-12:00 and the ‘Jwale ke Nako’ show will be broadcast between 12:00-15:00, delivered by Thuso ‘O nketsang’ Motaung and Matshogo ‘DJ Stix’ Mahloko. The afternoon drive time show, ‘Re a kubeletsa’ will continue to be presented by Nyakallo ‘Ba2Cada’ Leine from Monday to Friday (15:00-18:00). The station has retained the majority of its on-air personalities with others being moved to other slots or allocated new responsibilities. Zanele ‘Nestum’ Nyakale will be taking up the role of station coordinator in Gauteng, because veteran broadcaster Phelane ‘Master P’ Sothoane has retired. African Language Station Motsweding FM has also announced changes in its presenter line-up, “underscoring the need to stay relevant, competitive and to reflect the multifaceted interests of all its audience age groups”, according to a release. New additions to station’s line-up include well-known, on-air personalities Tumi Morake, Ikanyeng Modubu, and the return of Mokopi MKP Molebatsi and Modisane Modise. Amon Mokoena and Tumi Morake will host the weekday breakfast show, ‘ Di Rage’. From 1 June 2019, the show will migrate to a 06:00–09:00 time slot. Lebo Leabile will continue to present the mid-morning show ‘Resemeletse’ (09:00-12:00) and Mokopi MKP Molebatsi will deliver the midday show ‘Oketsa’ (12:00-15:00). Molebatsi will also present the Sunday night soul show ‘Sepelong’ (21:00-00:00). Lucas LTK Komanisi remains the host of the afternoon drive time show, ‘Gotetsa Mosha’ (weekdays, 15:00-18:00). Other key developments are that Kb Molopyane will present the weekday Sports show ‘Mabaleng’ (19:00-20:00) and Lindiwe Modise will present ‘Nna Le wena’ from Monday to Thursday (20:00-00:00). A new religious programme, Tsa Tumelo, has been introduced for Thursday Nights (20:00-00:00), with the host interchanging between Modisane Modise, Pastor Motsamai Brown Mosiapoa, and Moruti Tube. Ikanyeng Modubu will team up with Tomaeza for ‘Kgotlha O Mone’ from Monday to Friday (00:00-03:00). ‘Ke Mo Teng’ has been moved to Saturdays (12:00-15:00), and the station will introduce ‘Moribo Wa Afrika’ to be presented by the seasoned presenter Tom Perez on the same day (21:00-00:00). Brown Mosiapoa and Moruti Tube, who present the show ‘Rorisang’, will move to the earlier Sunday slot 06:00-08:00 making way for ‘Tsa Tumelo’ between 08:00 and 10:00 with Modisane Modise and Pastor Motsamai. Motsweding FM station manager Katlego Mokhele says of the changes, “We want to explore new ways in which to grow audiences while instilling appreciation of the Setswana culture and language. The changes also reflect our commitment to empowering more women in a traditionally male-dominated industry. The station will build on the latest listenership increase that was influenced by changes made by the station at the beginning of April 2018.” The station is looking to grow its listenership in Gauteng, Free State, Northern Cape and Limpopo, while maintaining its current numbers in the North West.
