The SABC has revealed changes to presenter line-ups at three of its radio stations, Good Hope FM, Ukhozi FM and trufm, all effective from 1 April 2019. The most anticipated news coming out of Good Hope FM was who was going to replace Nigel Pierce on the station’s weekday afternoon drive show. That coveted spot was handed to Khanya Siyengo, better known as Kyeezi, The Tall Wonder, who will be hosting ‘The Great Drive with Kyeezi’ (weekdays, 15:00-18:00). More female-hosted shows was another revelation for Good Hope FM, with Geri Saunders hosting a brand new show, ‘It’s about time’ (Monday to Thursday, 18:00-21:00), and on Fridays ‘Doctor’s in the House with Dr Jules’ continuing as usual. “Both Kyeezi and Geri are currently part of the on-air team at the station and have already more than proved themselves to be ideal candidates for their new shows,” says station manager Brendan Ficks. He adds, “Our 2019 line-up is packed with talent and diversity, offering our listeners dynamic shows, hosted by presenters who are at the top of their game.” The station’s weekend line-up will also see two new presenters and shows added to the mix with Yonda Bass (Sunday, 09:00-12:00) and Tamara Snow taking the late night Sunday slot (22:00-01:00). South Africa’s most-listened to radio station Ukhozi FM, which currently commands 7.5 million listeners, sees the most changes occurring on its weekday line-up. Tshatha Ngobe joins Nongcebo McKenzie on the 06:30 – 09:00 breakfast show ‘Vuka Mzansi’, while the mid-morning show ‘Jabul’Ujule’ (09:00-12:00) remains unchanged with Dudu Khoza still driving the show. The 12:00-15:00 slot ‘Ndiza Nathi’ sees a new radio vibe and energy, pairing Selbeyonce with Siya Mhlongo. Mzokhona “Mzokoloko” Gumede joins the station on the afternoon drive show ‘Woza Nabangani Bakho’ (15:00-18:00) as he co-presents with Nonhlanhla “Mroza” Buthelezi. Other new arrivals at the station include “King Sifiso” Sibiya, who takes the reins for the weekend dance shows, ‘Bhampa 2 Bhampa’ (Friday nights, 20:00-23:00) and ‘Chillas’ (Saturday afternoons, 15:00-18:00), and Phindile Phewa who will anchor the ‘Ulibo Lokuqala’ show (Tuesdays to Fridays, 04:00-05:00). Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe returns to the popular maskandi show, ‘Sigiya Ngengoma’ (Saturday mornings, 09:00-12:00) to co-host with Zimiphi Biyela, and Sbu Buthelezi returns to present the ‘Indumiso’ programme (Sunday mornings, 08:00-11:30). Mandla “Njinji” Magwaza crosses over to present the ‘Ukhozi Top 20’ show (Saturday, 12:00-15:00), while Zandile “Zeal” Dladla takes over ‘Fakumoya’ (Saturday, 22:00-02:00). Bheka ‘Beekay’ Mchunu will now present the ‘Cothoza Mfana’ show (Saturday, 05:00-06:00) and ‘Ikhethelo’ (Saturday, 07:00-09:00) and Mdonso Ngcobo will present ‘Kwasa Olungaliyo’ (Sunday, 02:00-04:00). Boniswa Moto will present ‘Youth ke Yona’ (Sunday, 14:30 – 15:00) as well as co-present the ‘UNkulunkulu Nomuntu Omusha’ show (Sunday, 20:00-21:00) with Thembeka Zondo. Lindani ‘Lee’ Hlophe will present a new programme, ‘Uju Lomphefumulo’ (Sunday, 23:00-02:00) as well as ‘Namba Namba’ (Friday, 23:00-02:00). Commenting on the reason for the presenter shifts, Ukhozi FM’s acting station manager Sbongi Ngcobo says, “The station has held intense deliberations, leading to the biggest changes in recent years. The objective of the line-up changes is to ensure strategic brand positioning of our on-air personalities for maximum audience appeal and marketability, for Ukhozi FM to retain its position as the leading radio station in the country.” On the trufm side, listeners will now wake up to an energetic and informative breakfast show ‘truMornings’, which will be hosted by Reggie Solani. He will be joined by co-host A.J. Maclean (moving from the midday show). With Maclean’s move, Buck Matyila will be the sole presenter of the midday show. Phethu Soga will move from the afternoon drive to host the Current Affairs programme ‘truNewsHour@11’ (weekdays, 11:00-12h00 and Sundays, 17:00-18:00). Blaq Maci will move to the mid-morning programme ‘truExperience’ (weekdays, 08:00-11:00). An extra hour has been added to the popular weekly Christian lifestyle programme, ‘Hlalani Kum, Mna ndihlale kuni’, with Pastor Bathandwa Khwatsha (19:00-22:00), which will be followed by the programme ‘After Hours’ (22:00-01:00) with Dee Lukes. Another addition and change will occur with the station’s popular Hip Hop music specialist show, which is currently known as ‘Ground Zero’, as it moves to Saturdays between 13:00 and 15:00, with Makhi “Yahkeem” Fibi at the helm. On the new line-up changes, trufm’s acting station manager Masixole Mdingane says, “The station is very proud to present such great talent as a team, that will deliver quality programming and listener engagements through exciting marketing campaigns in the next fiscal as we gear-up to make an impact as a truly Eastern Cape youthful brand.” Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?
