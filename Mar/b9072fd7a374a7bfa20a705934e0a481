Kfm 94.5 has unveiled its new Sunday line-up, which takes effect on 31 March 2019. The move includes an exciting new addition to the station, as media personality and businesswoman, Saskia Falken returns to radio. She will host the new #KfmSundaze breakfast show at 7-10am (the show’s team pictured left). Falken’s show is followed by Brandon Leigh (10am – 3pm) and Tim Thabethe (3-7pm), before Mamohau Seseane takes the microphone with Kfm Sunday Love Songs from 7pm. Falken is an experienced broadcaster with more than fifteen years on-air experience at various Cape Town commercial radio stations. She returns to on-air after taking a five-year hiatus, during which she cemented her off-air career in business and as senior marketing manager for Primedia Broadcasting Cape Town.
