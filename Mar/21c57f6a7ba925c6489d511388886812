Primedia Broadcasting’s Cape Town-based, talk radio station, CapeTalk, has announced a strategic shift to its daytime line-up, which will take effect during this month. The modification sees the twenty-one-year-old station welcome finance, business and lifestyle maven Refilwe Moloto. She will host a new mid-morning program called “Upfront with Refilwe Moloto”. Listeners will know Moloto as a weekly finance and business contributor to the popular Afternoon Drive with John Maytham show, in addition to her various stand ins on other programs including Breakfast and The Money Show. Upfront with Refilwe starts on Monday 11 March 2019 and will serve the CapeTalk audience, replacing The Eusebius McKaisier show, which has been simulcast with sister station 702. The Eusebius McKaiser show will continue broadcasting to its 702 audience in Johannesburg and beyond. “Research and a perpetual review of our offering have fuelled the decision to prioritise Cape Town-related news and issues during the mid-mornings. “Upfront with Refilwe” will provide Capetonians with a healthy mix of current affairs, lifestyle, fashion and business. International news and trends will feature too,” explains CapeTalk programme manager, Tessa van Staden. She added, “Refilwe is well known to the CapeTalk audience. Her passion for the city and her broad interests will be reflected. The show will also hold true to the station’s commitment to making information accessible. Refilwe won’t shy away from talking tough. I want to thank Eusebius McKaiser for his dedication and commitment to having brave conversations that have challenged our audience”. “I am honoured to join the CapeTalk family in a permanent capacity. The station offers a world-class approach to broadcasting and when the opportunity came, to be involved on a more consistent basis, I could not resist. I look forward to creating meaningful conversations and forging a special relationship with our audience” said Moloto. In addition to discussing the news and information of the day. “Upfront with Refilwe” will engage high profile personalities about the lesser-known aspects of their lives, habits and major influences during the 3rd hour (11am) of the show called “Up Close & Personal”.
