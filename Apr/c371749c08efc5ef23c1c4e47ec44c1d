SABC radio station 5FM has introduced a few changes to its presenter line-up. A release from the station said, “5FM, which is historically known to deliver the hottest and latest music, will continue to focus its attention on ensuring its music offering is both strong and cutting-edge. ‘The Ultimix’ presented by “Weekender5”, will continue to take centre-stage weekdays (18:00-19:00). DJ Loyd and Ryan the DJ will present on Mondays, Kyle Cassim on Tuesdays, Ms Cosmo on Wednesdays, Das Kapital and Pascal & Pearce on Thursdays and the resident DJ every Friday. Justin Toerien and Stephanie B have held down the fort from Mondays – Thursdays with the ‘Top 10 @ 10’ which has been renamed ‘Music Capital’ where listeners will hear brand new tracks from around the world. Das Kapital extends his dance and electronic contribution with a second show ‘In Das we Trust’ on Fridays (22:00-01:00) and ‘In Das we Trust; Raveyard Edition’ every Saturday night (22:00–01:00) replacing DJ Loyd’s ‘The Uncut Mixtape’. DJ Loyd now presents at a new time-slot on Saturdays and Sundays (14:00–17:00), with the best of hip hop and house music on ‘The House Connect’ (Saturdays) and a focus on South African trends (Sundays) with ‘The Uncut Mixtape’. Weekend Breakfast gets a shake-up as Nicole da Silva takes the reigns on ‘5FM Xtra Loud Weekend Mornings’ alongside Jude van Wyk on sport and Sibs Matiyela on news. Nadia Romanos moves to news on ‘The Thabooty Drive’ alongside Thando Thabethe and Msizi James (Monday – Friday, 15:00–18:00). Msizi James, co-host on ‘The Thabooty Drive’ takes over the ‘5FM Top 40‘ music show on Saturdays (10:00–14:00), while Vic Naidoo takes control on Sundays (10:00-14:00) with a focus on listener music choices. In a bid to get the party started early on weekends, Saturdays from 17:00-19:00 will play host to Ryan the DJ’s ‘5tarting from 5cratch’ show followed by a Saturday edition of ‘The Kyle Cassim Show’ (19:00–22:00) and ‘In Das we Trust: Raveyard Edition’ (22:00–01:00). Sunday’s music offering will remain relatively unchanged with ‘Selective Styles’ with Kid Fonque from (17:00–19:00) and Ms Cosmo’s ‘The Stir Up’ (19:00–22:00). The only change sees Ryan the DJ return for a Sunday edition of his show ‘5tarting from 5cratch’ (22:00-01:00). Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?
