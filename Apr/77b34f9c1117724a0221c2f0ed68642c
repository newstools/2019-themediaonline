In the season of radio presenter shifts at the SABC, the line-ups for three more of its stations; Umhlobo Wenene, Munghana Lonene FM, and Phalaphala FM have been revealed. Umhlobo Wenene took the decision to add no new presenters to its line-up, instead opting to shuffle its talent around and introduce new shows. ‘Iingcebiso Ngezomthetho’ has been introduced (weekdays, 21:30-22:30), which will look into legal matters and will be presented by Luckeez Matyolweni, with a resident advocate. ‘Zibuzwa kuthi’ (weekdays, 12:00–13:00) will now be presented by Siphosethu Nonganga. Mafa Bavuma moves to the ‘BEE Show’ (weekdays, 06:30–09h00). These changes will be effective from 3 June 2019. Another new programme ‘Masixolelane’ (Mondays, 22:00–00:00), which replaces ‘Usagoduka Nha?’, will be presented by Tsidi Monteiro. Elvis Mali will continue to present the ‘Umculo WeJazz’  (Sundays, 22:00–00:00) and ‘Ezolimo’ (Fridays, 03:00-04:30). Station manager Phumzile Mnci, who is also the acting provincial general manager of Eastern Cape says, “I am thrilled to introduce this new line-up, which I believe will deliver innovative and cutting edge programming. Umhlobo Wenene FM listeners can also look forward to new and vibrant features across our programmes that will be introduced incrementally in the next three months”. Over at Munghana Lonene FM, several exciting changes are happening. The station will kick-off weekdays with 5 hours of listener’s choice music (00:00–05:00).

The station’s programme manager Lawrence Ubisi says, “The new line-up and innovative content will reflect the station’s new strategy of attracting audiences who were not necessarily following Munghana Lonene FM, it will also serve the Vatsonga nation, speak to new age listeners, whilst retaining our programming content that will resonate with loyal listeners.” Phalaphala FM has also made some changes to its line-up. These include an all music show between 00:00 and 05:00 (weekdays). From 00:00 to 06:00 on weekends, the station will usher in the fresh voice of Rampsie Rampfumedzi ”The Luv Doc” (Sundays, 10:00-12:00). There are also personalities changing slots.

Acting station manager, Rudzani Mashamba comments, “Given the relatively good number of listenership for Phalaphala FM, the station felt bringing minimal changes will retain consistency in line with listener’s demands, at the same time working on strategies for expansion and growth within the current paradigm and few innovations.” Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?
