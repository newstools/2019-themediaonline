As we begin a New Year, I wanted to share some truths for on air performers in 2019. These are my beliefs. You may not agree with me and that’s fine. I think the most important thing is that we get the chance to stop, think and debate what needs to happen this year in order for us – and our industry – to be better than we were last year. Reflection is the key to learning; these are the thoughts that resonate most deeply with me as I reflect on what talent should be thinking about this year. Here are my 15 truths for talent. In no particular order… As we get set for another great year creating meaningful content ask yourself, “What do you want to be true about your performance this year?” I wish you a truly successful year!
