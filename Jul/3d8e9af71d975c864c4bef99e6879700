Media consultant Gordon Muller recently unpacked Nielsen’s SA Digital Consumer Survey at an Ebony + Ivory event. The research offers some fascinating insights into different media types and their interplay with, as well as how each are tracked and compared. The key takeaway message was: “This study is a recognition that the proliferation of media devices and platforms means the old way, the way I grew up doing media in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, has gone. You cannot think in silos. We have to think about media from a holistic perspective,” stresses Muller. A key finding was that brands need to compare the behaviours of different generations (as they vary from Born Frees to Baby Boomers and all in between), and match their marketing strategy with where the generations they are targeting can be found and their behaviours. Here are some of the main points emerging from the research: Nielsen’s Digital Consumer Survey has been weighted in such a way that it can be fused with the Establishment Survey (ES) hub, allowing media practitioners to compare it and use it in collaboration with other ES-linked research, including BRC RAM, BRC TAMS, PAMS and Nielsen’s BrandScan. Muller strongly advises that media practitioners do this, as it paints a more thorough, in-depth picture of audiences and how media can target them more efficiently.
