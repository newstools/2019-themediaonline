The wait is over! People wondering where DJ Fresh was headed, after being let go from SABC, now have their answer. He will be joining Primedia Broadcasting’s 947, hosting the station’s weekday afternoon drive show, Fresh on 947, from 1 August 2019. Since departing the public broadcaster, DJ Fresh has been popping up all over the place, leading to much speculation. From Newzroom Afrika, to Kaya FM, to Idols SA, the Big Dawg has certainly been keeping busy, and seemed to be in a happy space since his SABC departure. Aside from an official statement from 947, DJ Fresh (real name Thato Sikwane) confirmed the news via this tweet on his official account: #FreshOn947 pic.twitter.com/ztDGWX92dQ — DJ Fresh (Big Dawg) (@DJFreshSA) July 22, 2019  Excited about his move to the station, DJ Fresh says: “I look forward to engaging with my loyal following at my new home, 947. I started my radio career as an afternoon drive presenter and look forward to joining 947 for my new show, in this new timeslot. Listeners can expect a kick ass team, kick ass show, a lot of entertainment, laughter and finally being back on radio.” READ MORE DJ Fresh apologises and reveals start date for new show SABC terminates DJ Fresh’s contract with immediate effect The DJ Fresh, SABC situation: What is going on?
