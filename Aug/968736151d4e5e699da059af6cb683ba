Hashtag by hashtag. The news cycle continued its crazy pace this week, with the Gavin Watson death crash dominating headlines. The #RamaphosaLeaks story has finally moved from top spot in the weekly media hit parade compiled by Acumen Media and based on social media activity. If social media is the gauge, South Africans are having a ‘ja right’ moment over the Bosasa boss’s death. Acumen Media’s social media monitoring found not a single person believed the crash was an accident. Chaos in the Pretoria CBD was the second most riveting story in the news. What was the truth behind the eruption. Taxis, drug dealers, police… a toxic cocktail for sure. “What a week huh? Did you buy the Watson story? If so, you were in isolation,” wrote Acumen Media‘s Tonya Khoury.  Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms? Comment on Twitter @MediaTMO or on our Facebook page.
